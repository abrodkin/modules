#  Modulepath initial setup
#  ========================
#
#  This file defines the initial setup for the module files search path.
#  Comments may be added anywhere, which begin on # and continue until the 
#     end of the line
#  Each line containing a single path will be added to the MODULEPATH
#     environment variable. You may add as many as you want - just
#     limited by the maximum variable size of your shell.
