****************************   Release 3.2 ******************************
Modules 3.2.0
	* Made the .modulesbeginenv facility optional (default is
	  not to have it)
	* default for cache is now "no"
	* Added version_test() to testsuite to make some of the
	  tests conditional on the values generated by --version.
	* Reworked every configure-based file
	  - the configure options help is formatted with AC_HELP_STRING
	  - uses automake to generate most of the Makefile.in
	  - renamed configure.in to configure.ac per autoconf
	  - Versioning is optional now with a configure option
	  - reworked the init scripts for versioning or not
	  - eliminated acconfig.h and put templates in configure.ac
	  - make install now honors the DESTDIR variable for package builds
	  - honors bindir for modulecmd location
	   (but the init scripts are only correct if no versioning)
	* Collected the usage info and now it can be displayed with
	  the --help or -H option (same as help)
	* --version now gives most of the optional configure parameters
	  for easy debugging of problems
	* Made the output deterministic (sorted) and reworked tests also
	* Fixed the UserLevel check code (which failed when optimized)

	Contributor:
	 	Mark Lakata  		<lakata@mips.com>
	* removed configure *.in files from testsuite and added envvars to
	  allow running the testsuite from another directory
	* other fixes to testsuite
	* allowed one argument for 'switch', i.e. "module switch foo/1.3"
	  is the same as "module switch foo foo/1.3"
	* bug fix in cmdXResources regarding parsing the XRDB
	* removed probetcl from distribution; function moved to aclocal.m4
        * special shell chars in env vars are escaped rather than
	  quoted. This allows the use of single quotes inside the env var
	* noglob option turned on for module command in csh/tcsh
	* use customed temp file routine, rather than tmpnam or tempnam
	* minor bugs

	 	Leo Butler		<lbutler@brocade.com>)
		Philip Kearns		<Philip.Kearns@tellabs.com>
		Andy Bruce		<abruce@infocruiser.com>
	* A 'break' in a modulefile will cause the modulefile to
	  not be added to $LOADEDMODULES, but will be considered
	  a successful execution to not affect other modulefiles
	  being loaded concurrently (Patch due to Scott Gaskins).
	* Tests and docs added for the above.

	* Fixed problem with module load when the full path
	  is given (patch due to Scott Gaskins).
	* Added tests for the above problem.

	  (patch due to Philip Kearns).
	* Modified probetcl to use tclsh first then tcl
	* Added TCL_VERSION to configure and use it in the Makefile
	  to use the -ltcl@TCL_VERSION@ library.
	
Modules 3.1.5
Sat Aug 18 07:32:48 PDT 2001		R.K. Owen (rk@owen.sj.ca.us)
	Contributors:
		Eric Stanley		<barnabas@knicknack.net>
	* Fixed up cmdPath to remove individual items from a path
	  (patch due to Eric Stanley).
	* Fixed problem of failed "module loads" in a modulefile
	  (patch due to Eric Stanley).
Modules 3.1.4
Fri Aug  3 12:45:55 PDT 2001		R.K. Owen (rk@owen.sj.ca.us)
	* Some preliminary steps to a rpm file.
	* Added bz2 files to distribution mix.
	* Fixed "module swap" to put the substituted module in the
	  same path location as the old.  Also added a number of tests
	  for this feature.
	  (Bug was pointed out by Leo Butler <lbutler@brocade.com>)
	* Added tests for the "is-loaded" modulefile command introduced
	  back in 3.0.8-rko.
	* Fixed up some documents.
Modules 3.1.3
Wed Jul 11 14:30:53 PDT 2001		R.K. Owen (rk@owen.sj.ca.us)
	* Added module-cvs modulefile for easy CVS/ftp access to the
	  modules CVS repository.
	* Added README.perl describing Ron Isaacson's Env::Modulecmd
	  perl module (Ron.Isaacson@morganstanley.com).
	* Added document file INSTALL.RH7x which explains how to set up
	  an modules environment for all users through the system shell
	  files.  Is specific to Linux/RedHat 7.x, but is of general
	  applicability.
	* Added further tests for modulefile "module use dir_path"
	* Fixed bug of unloading a modulefile with a "module use dir_path"
	* Environment variable contents are now quoted to preserve
	  any embedded environment variables. (Needed for versioning)
	* Added over 50 tests specific to module versioning, and testing
	  xgetenv.
	* Fixed the unsetenv on unload function, the feature added in 3.0.6-rko
	  was supposed to set the env.var. to the optional third argument.
	  This was to allow old env.var. values to be recovered by unraveling
	  a stack set in an other env.var.  Added tests for this feature.
	  This is used by the version modulefile.
	* Fixed and updated the version modulefile to allow stacked
	  versions to be removed the stack.
	* Removed an annoying spurious stderr newline.
	
Modules 3.1.2
Fri Jun  8 23:12:24 PDT 2001		R.K. Owen (rk@owen.sj.ca.us)

	  for "module use", "module use --append", and "module unuse".
	* Changed the global variable names (flags,current_module) to
	  (g_flags, g_current_module) to identify their ubiquity in the
	  module source.
Modules 3.1.1
Thu Feb  1 11:20:44 PST 2001		Robert Minsk (egbert@centropolisfx.com)
	Contributors:
		Robert Minsk		<egbert@centropolisfx.com>
	* init file for python added (Robert Minsk)
	* Added the beginnings of support for scheme.  Still need an init
	  script. (Robert Minsk)
	* Fixed bug with the _LMFILES_ environment variable.  If a user was
	  using a csh variant of a shell and modules was compiled
	  with with-split-size enable the _LMFILES_ variable was not
	  handled correctly when it needed splitting. (Robert Minsk)
	* Fixed bug with creating aliases for ksh, bash, and zsh to
	  recognize the escape ("\").  Any time an alias had a "$"
	  in it a function was created instead of an alias. (Robert Minsk)
	* Fixed bug in searching the LOADEDMODULES environment variable.
	  Would not find a module if only a partial module name was given.
	  (Robert Minsk)
	* Fixed memory corruption bug in LOADEDMODULES environment variable
	  handling. (Robert Minsk)
	* Fixed bug in csh init file.  Some versions of csh echo the current
	  prompt if the shell was in an eval of an eval (eval `eval ...`).
	  (Robert Minsk)
	* Started adding support for mel (Maya Extension Language)
	  (Robert Minsk)

	Note: Since I have just recently become a co-maintainer of modules with
	      R.K. Owen it has been hard to keep up with user submitted
	      patches.  If you did not receive proper credit for a fix or
	      enhancement that has appeared in this release you will
	      receive proper credit in the next release.  Robert Minsk
Modules 3.1.0
	Contributors:
		Jens Hamisch		<jens@Strawberry.COM>
		Robert Minsk		<egbert@centropolisfx.com>
		Magnus Holmberg		<mho@mho.nu>

	  (patch due to Jens Hamisch).
	* Removed warning message for unloading a module that's not loaded.
	* Added source code cross-referencing via cxref-1.5b(patched)
	  (see http://www.gedanken.demon.co.uk/cxref/ for details).
	* Changed the long format, eliminated the release column as a separate
	  entity.  The release value is just part of the package name.
	* Added --with-dot.ext[=<.ext>] to configure & DOT_EXT to config.h
	  for an extension to be added to the shell dot-file names for the
	  "module init*" commands

	  (due to Robert Minsk).
	* Fixed tests with regards to syslogging & alias.
	* Licensed changed to GPL.

****************************   Release 3.0 ******************************
Modules 3.0.8-rko
Wed May 10 09:45:55 PDT 2000		R.K. Owen (rk@owen.sj.ca.us)
	Contributors:
		Steve Muskiewicz	<smuskiew@nortelnetworks.com>
		Robert Minsk		<egbert@centropolisfx.com>
	* Added another option to the module-info command named "specified"
	  which gives the name as specified on the command line.
	  This patch is due to Robert Minsk.
	* Added the beginnings of python support.  Still need an init
	  script.  This patch is due to Robert Minsk.
	* Changed the numbering of modules during a terse listing.
	  Instead of numbering left-to-right row by row, number
	  top-down by columns ... this corresponds to the order
	  of modules.  Patch is compliments of Steve Muskiewicz.
	* Fixed a modulefile unload of another modulefile problem.
	  This patch is due to Steve Muskiewicz.
	* Fixed swap bug with setenv.  Patch due to Robert Minsk.
	* Added 'is-loaded' to test whether a given module is loaded
	  or not already.  (need to add testsuite.) Provided by Robert Minsk.
Modules 3.0.7-rko
Fri Apr  7 10:58:45 PDT 2000		R.K. Owen (rk@owen.sj.ca.us)
	* Fixed xgetenv
	* A bunch of patches from Robert Minsk
	  that eliminates a lot of the compile time warnings
	  (mostly unused variables etc.)
	* More patches from Robert Minsk for the --disable-cache
	  option.
	* Modified add.modules to provisionally handle .bash_profile
	  and .bash_login (thanks to Ted Richards).
	* Modified the way shell start-up files are specified in init.c
	  with patches from Max Zomborszki.  Now easier for a site
	  to make local customizations.
Modules 3.0.6-rko
Wed Feb 16 09:06:34 PST 2000		R.K. Owen (rk@owen.sj.ca.us)
	* Changed "unsetenv" to allow an optional third argument to
	  set the env.var. to when unloading.
	* Fixed bugs with and upgraded the "module init*" commands.
	* Added a preliminary RPM .spec file ... some of the versioning
	  changes conflict with some RPM features.
Modules 3.0.5-rko	(not meant for public release)
Fri Jan 21 18:59:18 PST 2000		R.K. Owen (rk@owen.sj.ca.us)
	* Changed the behavior if "module" is called without an argument.
	  In addition to the error message it prints out the help text.
	* Fixed a problem with module swapping. A test needs to be
	  added to the testsuite.
	* Rewrote many of the init files & modified modules to allow
	  one level of env.var. expansion in the MODULEPATH & MODULERCFILE
	  environment variables.  The purpose is to allow the co-existence
	  of many versions of the module command.
	  Only this & successive versions will implement this.
	* Got the --with-logging configure option actually doing something
	  in the code.  The default is no syslog-ing.
	  However, this affects the tests ... expect 3 failures originating
	  from testsuite/modules.50-cmds/100-loglevel.exp .
	  (fixed in version 3.0.9-rko)
Modules 3.0.4-rko
Wed Jan 12 09:45:21 PST 2000		R.K. Owen (rk@owen.sj.ca.us)
	* Rewrote a lot of the calls to low level Tcl RegExp
	  routines, which required direct access to the tclRegexp.h
	  header file.
	  Used higher level Tcl routines to accomplish the same.
	  The net result is that modules should be configurable under
	  any version of Tcl > 7.4 (not tested).
	* Rewrote a reference to a low level Tcl glob routine, which
	  required direct access to the tclInt.h header file.
	  Used the $HOME environment instead.
	* Mean-time hack to support multiple subdirectories for the
	  "avail" option.
	* Fixed the long listings to be Y2K OK.
	* Added a version option to print out the module version ...
	  for future automated scripting.
	* Some documentation clean-up.
	* Removed all references to PARSEABLE_ERRORS in config.h
	  and configuration ... since it's not used at all.
	* Modified init files because some systems treat undefined
	  variables in sh/ksh/bash/zsh as errors and terminates login
	  process (Thanks to Martin Jost).
	* Modified Tcl_HashTable declaration initialization to 
	  assignment, because some ANSI C compilers complain
	  (Thanks to Martin Jost).
Modules 3.0.3-rko
Thu Dec 23 08:20:44 PST 1999		R.K. Owen (rk@owen.sj.ca.us)
	* removed the global definition refering to stdout and put
	  the assignment in one of the routines.  This fixes a
	  compilation problem with RedHat 6.1 & gcc-2.95.
Modules 3.0.2-rko
Thu Nov 11 16:57:30 PST 1999		R.K. Owen (rk@owen.sj.ca.us)
	* added the --[enable|disable]-version-magic option to the
	  configure script and associated sources.  However, `disabling'
	  will break the ./modules.20-locate/030-defvers.exp test.
	  `disabling' allows older modulefile directories that don't
	  have .version files with proper module magic cookies to be
	  parsed.
	* Disabled errorlogging if "module avail" can't open a
	  directory.
	* Added some logic in the Makefile & elsewhere to generate
	  patch-able diff files.
Modules 3.0.1-rko
Tue Oct 26 12:47:58 PDT 1999		R.K. Owen (rk@owen.sj.ca.us)

Mon Jul 10 22:00:03 MET 1995		John Furlani (John.Furlani@eng.sun.com)

	* configure.in: Simplification by using new autoconf macros

Tue Dec 20 11:10:03 MET 1994		Peter W. Osel (pwo@guug.de)
Tue Dec 20 08:53:14 MET 1994		Martin S.Utesch (wstd@hl.siemens.de)

	* aclocal.m4:
		- local macro AC_DEFINE_PROG removed; it is no longer
			needed, replaced by AC_PATH_PROG_SEARCH and
			separately setting of the CPPSTDIN variable.

		- new macro AC_PATH_PROG_SEARCH: similar to autoconf
			2.1 macro AC_PATH_PROG, however does not search
			the PATH but a given list of directories for
			program.

		- improved macros AC_FIND_TCL, AC_FIND_TCLX, AC_MAKE_INCLUDE,
			AC_MAKE_LIBRARY, AC_SET_STATIC
			added caching and messages, warn if extendedn
			Tcl not found, abort if Tcl not found,
			AC_FIND_TCLX now rewuires AC_FIND_TCL

	* configure.in:
		- local macro AC_DEFINE_PROG replaced with AC_PATH_PROG_SEARCH

			this removes the bug, that CPPSTDIN was always
			set to '${CC} -E'

		- option '--with-x11' removed, now using standard --with-x,
			--x-includes, and --x-libraries options.

		- fixes bug that --with-x11 had to be given even if
			--x-includes, or --x-libraries had been given.

		- search for X11 libraries and includes via standard
			autoconf macro AC_PATH_XTRA:

			. variables 'x_includes', 'x_libraries' become
				available with 'configure' command line options
				'--x-includes=...' and '--x-libraries=...';
				'--with-x' is arbitrary (see `AC_PATH_XTRA');
			. X compiler flags added to output variable
				X_CFLAGS (which replaces own X11_INC_DIR variable)
			. X linker flags are added to output variable
				X_LIBS (which replaces X11_LIB_DIR)
			. special libraries are added to X_EXTRA_LIBS
	* modules_def.h: Removed include of sysconf.h
				for x libraries, need them for TclX, though

		- search for SYSV -lsocket and -lnsl no longer needed
			for tclx, when AC_PATH_XTRA has been called before;

		- required search for tclx after tcl (thus AC_FIND_TCL is required);

		- improved output messages, caching in `configure.in'; 

	* Makefile.in: 
		@X_EXTRA_LIBS@ added to `LIBS';
		@X11_INC_DIR@ replaced with standard @X_CFLAGS@;
		@X11_LIB_DIR@ replaced with standard @X_LIBS@;

Tue Nov 22 08:22:40 MET 1994		Peter W. Osel (pwo@guug.de)

	* configure.in: function matherr is not part of the math library
		off my Linux 1.x installation.  log() seems to be in all

	test is now changed to an #ifndef.

	* aclocal.m4: Created a new M4 macro, AC_SELECT_PROG. I need
